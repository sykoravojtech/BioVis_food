    Cooking is one of the most common and (ful)filling hobbies. Especially since the last two years
    of lockdowns and restrictions, more people started experimenting in their chemical laboratories
    known as kitchens. And what probably many of you know well, after a few weeks of home cook-
    ing we need to boost our inspiration, unless we want to make the same meals over and over again.
